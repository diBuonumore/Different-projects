# About projects
Here I will upload projects from different subjects & categories (rather associated with design such as logos, web projects, planners etc.). I am really excited to share them with you and I hope they will be helpful and inspiring. I have plenty of ideas in my mind, just I need some time to implement them into reality. Stay tuned!

#Project 1 - planner

Why did I create it? I was looking for a planner as a gift to my boyfriend but I could not find the one which will meet my requirements. I want it to be something special, ideal. One day I thought: Why not to make a planner on my own? And here it is.
